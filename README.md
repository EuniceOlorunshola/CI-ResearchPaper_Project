# Secruity systems built for vehicle thefts using Convolutional Neural Networks

# Description on this project 
I did this project for my computational intelligence class as a graduate student 
It contains a documentation folder that shows my research paper in IEEE format , and my presentaiton file  which goes over the overview of my paper. I also have a code folder that contains the two code files I created in python using juypter notebooks on Anaconda. 

# Directions to access the codes:
The code was coded in juypter notebook which is the source code editor that I recommended to use to run the code , but other editors can be used as well such as:visual studio code and Pycharm.

# FaceRecognition.ipynb(Code file)
* Steps to access the code:
1. click on the green button on the top right which says code then click on download zip file 
2. Extract the zip folder into your local computer
3. After the zip folder is extracted 
4. If Anaconda Navigator is not already isntalled, please install it 
5. After the installation is complete or if it is already installed 
6. Click on the extracted zip folder located in your local computer 
7. Then click on Codes folder , then click on Face Recognition System , then locate FaceRecognition.ipynb file 
8. Open Anaconda then click on launch juypter notebook 
9. In juypter notebook you will see documents, downloads, and other folders from your local computer , please make sure for step number 2 , the zip folder is extracted into your documents or downloads folder to make it easier to locate on juypter notebook 
10. After you have located the FaceRecognition.ipynb file , click on it and it will open in juypter notebooks 
11. Now you can see my code but before you can run it , if not already installed please install the imported libraries by going back to the home page of jupyter notebook , the home page is the page you was on for step 9 and 10. 
12. Once you get on the home page you will see new on the top right , click on it and you will see terminal , please click on the terminal. 
13. Once the terminal is loaded, please install the imported libraries from my code if not already installed by using the following  commands: 
14. pip install opencv
15. pip install tensorflow 
16. pip install mtcnn 
17. Once the commands have been correctly installed , you can go back to my code and run the first part of my code which is the line of the imported libraries . If it runs correclty with no error then it shows that the imported libraries were installed correctly 
18. Once that is completed successfully , on the next line of code , please add your path of the classifier file that correlates with the path of the extracted folder. 
19. Also please add your path of the images.png file that correlates with the path of the extracted folder. 
20. Once the changes have been made correctly, you can run the rest of my code successfully.
